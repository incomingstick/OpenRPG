OpenRPG is still in its infancy and I want it to do a lot by v1.0.0!
What OpenRPG aims to accomplish two fold.

First, it will be a tool for someone to use to quickly create content
for a tabletop RPG world. v1.0.0 will focus specifically on the
5e rules, however I hope to have that expand out to include
Pathfinder and as far back as AD&D.

Secondly, OpenRPG should be structured in such a way that game developers
that want to emulate the d20 system in a video game could easily implement
our libraries in their games to help speed production of back end tools.

Some of the features this tool will include by v1.0.0 are:<br>
- A GUI front-end for the CLI tools<br>
- A dice simulation tool<br>
- A name generator tool<br>
- A character generator tool (with the option to autofill a character sheet)<br>
- A town generator tool<br>
- An encounter/combat generator tool<br>
- A world generator tool<br>
- A world/town map generator<br>

... And more (hopefully)!

v0.1.0 is a basis for the CLI/developer version, but v1.0.0 will contain a
portable GUI that works on Windows, Linux, and macOS.
